    <string name="why_i_did_choose_work_1">"\u2713 In Pakistan I noticed street lights staying on at dawn and at times even later. We were facing an energy crisis back then and this was an event that encouraged us to be innovative and come up with ideas to sustain energy. The basic idea was to turn the street lights automatically when the photoelectric sensor received sufficient light when transitioning from night to day."
